# Xenith - 1st Anniversary Edition

Xenith is a knock-off of a popular game called [Space Shooters](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/space-shooter-galaxy-attack/9p7kk4b97qv8?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) that I made for my Girlfriend on our 1st Anniversary using Pygame.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install dependencies.

```bash
pip install pygame
pip install webbrowser
pip install tkinter
```

## Usage

Write the following in the Terminal:
```python
python main.py
```
The game can by converted to an exe using either [pyinstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/) or [cx_Freeze](https://cx-freeze.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
